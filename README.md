# telegram-ai-tutor-chatbbot
An AI-powered personal tutor designed to provide personalized and interactive learning experiences. This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to offer customizable lessons, answer questions, and generate quizzes tailored to each student's needs and learning style.
ðŸ§  An Intelligent & Adaptive AI Tutor
The Problem
Traditional learning methods often lack personalization, making it difficult for students to receive tailored guidance that adapts to their individual pace and style. This can lead to a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to address specific learning gaps or provide timely, relevant assistance.

Our Solution
Our AI tutor prototype solves this by providing a highly intelligent and adaptive learning assistant directly on Telegram. By leveraging the combined power of the Google Gemini and OpenAI language models, our bot offers a dynamic and personalized learning experience. It can answer questions, create custom lessons, and provide instant, context-aware feedback, ensuring a truly adaptive educational experience.

Current Status
The core functionality of the AI tutor is fully operational and deployed on Telegram. We have successfully integrated the n8n workflow to connect the Telegram bot with both the OpenAI and Gemini APIs. The bot is currently able to:

Respond to user queries with intelligent and helpful answers.

Provide real-time learning assistance.

Pending work includes:

Adding a feature to track a user's progress over time.

Implementing a more robust memory to remember long-term conversations.

Developing an automated lesson-generation module.

Technologies and Tools
Our prototype is built using a low-code/no-code approach, leveraging powerful automation and AI tools.
